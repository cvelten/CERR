%  Type: String describing type of field, with 5 options:
%         '1' Field must exist, data must exist and be valid.
%         '2' Field must exist, data can exist and be valid, or be NULL.
%         '3' Field is optional, if the field exists data can exist and be
%             valid or be NULL.
%         '1C' Field must exist under certain conditions and contain valid

%         '2C' Field must exist under certain conditions and can contain
